# Contributing to Tiny Helpdesk Hero

Thanks for helping reboot Tiny Helpdesk Hero! The repository currently contains documentation only; code and assets will be reintroduced as we progress through the roadmap in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Getting Started
1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Read `README.md` for the product vision and `DEVELOPMENT.md` for engineering standards.
3. Comment on or open a GitHub issue before starting work so tasks stay coordinated. Use the labels suggested in the implementation plan (`UI`, `Audio`, `Enhancement`, `Gameplay`, `Docs`).

## Local Environment (once scaffolding returns)
- Primary workflow: `npx http-server -c-1` from the project root.
- Source layout will follow the structure described in `DEVELOPMENT.md` (`public/`, `src/`, `assets/`, `tests/`).
- Until that structure exists, contributions should focus on documentation, planning, and tooling setup.

## Contribution Types
- **Documentation & Planning:** Expand design notes, narrative guidelines, or testing procedures. Update checklists when tasks complete.
- **Infrastructure:** When Milestone 0 begins, help recreate the LittleJS bootstrap, tooling, or directory structure.
- **Systems & Content:** Follow-on milestones will open issues for conversation engine features, UI polish, audio design, and meta-humor writing.

## Workflow Expectations
- Branch per change (`docs/update-vision`, `feature/bootstrap-index-html`).
- Write clear commit messages detailing intent and scope.
- Keep pull requests small and focused; reference related issues in the description.
- Request review from another contributor before merging into `main`.
- Update documentation alongside code changes to keep the knowledge base accurate.

## Reporting Issues & Ideas
Use GitHub Issues for:
- Clarifying questions about requirements or tone.
- Suggestions for new features, personas, or accessibility improvements.
- Bugs discovered once the rebuild is underway (label appropriately).

## Code of Conduct
Humor should aim upward and celebrate empathy. Be respectful, inclusive, and collaborative in all interactions. If conflicts arise, escalate via GitHub Issues or direct contact with the maintainers for mediation.

We’re excited to rebuild this experience intentionally—thank you for being part of it!
