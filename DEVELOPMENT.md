# Best Practices for LittleJS Development

## 1. Optimizing Game Loops
- **Use requestAnimationFrame**: This method allows the browser to optimize rendering and improve performance. Always use `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother animations.

  ```javascript
  function gameLoop() {
      // Game logic and rendering
      requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
  ```

## 2. Rendering Techniques
- **Batch Rendering**: Minimize the number of draw calls by batching similar objects together. This can significantly improve rendering performance.

  ```javascript
  function batchRender(objects) {
      // Group and render objects
  }
  ```

## 3. Physics Management
- **Use Simple Physics for Lightweight Games**: Implement simple collision detection and response to keep the physics manageable. Avoid complex calculations unless absolutely necessary.

  ```javascript
  function detectCollision(obj1, obj2) {
      return obj1.x < obj2.x + obj2.width &&
             obj1.x + obj1.width > obj2.x &&
             obj1.y < obj2.y + obj2.height &&
             obj1.y + obj1.height > obj2.y;
  }
  ```

## 4. Modularization Strategies
- **Separate Concerns**: Organize your code into modules for better maintainability. Each module should handle a specific aspect of the game (e.g., input handling, rendering, game state).

  ```javascript
  // Input module
  const Input = {
      // Input handling logic
  };
  ```

## 5. Integration Tips
- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid over-engineering. Start with a minimal setup and expand as needed. Use existing libraries and frameworks where possible to save time.

  ```javascript
  // Quick integration example
  import { GameEngine } from 'littlejs';
  const engine = new GameEngine();
  ```

Remember, the key to successful game development with LittleJS is to keep your code clean, efficient, and well-organized. Happy coding!
