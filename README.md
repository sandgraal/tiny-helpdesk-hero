# Tiny Helpdesk Hero

**Tiny Helpdesk Hero** is an empathy-forward comedy game being built for the LittleJS Game Jam 2025. We‚Äôre starting from documentation-first planning so the experience, tooling, and content are intentional before production code lands.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Core documentation drafted (README, CONTRIBUTING, DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN).
- ‚è≥ Gameplay code, assets, and build tooling are planned but not yet implemented.
- üéØ Goal for this iteration: lock the creative direction, outline technical architecture, and capture the milestone plan inside the documentation set.

## Game Vision
- **Premise:** You are the lone support agent at TinyByte Helpdesk, fielding bite-sized tech catastrophes from larger-than-life callers.
- **Play loop:** Take procedurally remixed calls, listen for the real problem, choose empathetic responses, and balance speed with sincerity.
- **Tone:** Wholesome chaos. Every joke is rooted in kindness, every win celebrates empathy, and even the failures teach better bedside manner.
- **Victory:** Maintain a high satisfaction score through an 8-hour shift while unlocking meta-humorous achievements about tech tropes and tiny disasters.

## Planned Feature Pillars
- **Conversation Engine:** Modular persona/problem/twist generator, branching follow-up logic, empathy-aware scoring, and a growing database of call snippets.
- **UI & Accessibility:** Screen-space LittleJS interface with expressive animations, readable typography on small canvases, and options for dyslexia-friendly fonts and text scaling.
- **Audio & Mood:** ZzFX-driven soundscape with adaptive layers (hold music, caller motifs, empathy filters) that reinforce the emotional state of the shift.
- **Progression & Meta-Humor:** Achievement ribbons, fourth-wall commentary, and reactive callers that remember your advice.

## Technical Direction
- **Engine:** LittleJS delivered via CDN for jam compliance.
- **Project layout:** `src/` for ES modules (game loop, systems, content), `assets/` for art/audio after they exist, `public/` for deploy-ready HTML and `.nojekyll`.
- **Build tooling:** Simple static hosting during the jam (`npx http-server` locally, GitHub Pages in production). Optional lightweight bundling if module counts grow.
- **Testing:** Rapid manual playtests during development; scripted checks for data integrity (call validation, empathy scoring thresholds) once the generator lands.

## Documentation Map
- `README.md` (this file) ‚Äî product vision, high-level goals, and live status.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` ‚Äî milestone roadmap and task tracking.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` ‚Äî coding standards, workflow conventions, and engine tips.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` ‚Äî contributor expectations, onboarding steps, and collaboration etiquette.

## Immediate Priorities
1. Finalize the narrative/content bible (personas, problems, tonal guardrails).
2. Rebuild the LittleJS bootstrap in ES module form with clear seams for systems (`game`, `conversation`, `ui`, `audio`).
3. Prototype the conversation engine in isolation with mocked UI to validate data contracts.
4. Layer in accessible UI scaffolding (responsive layout, font choices, safe interaction zones).

Consult `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the detailed backlog and ownership notes. Once the foundational tasks above are underway we‚Äôll reinstate the build pipeline and begin committing gameplay code again.
