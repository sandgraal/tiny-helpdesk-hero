# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support security fixes only for the latest code on `main` and any tagged release cut from that branch. Historical jam prototypes or forks are considered out of scope.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| `main`  | ✅        |
| Latest tagged release | ✅ |
| Anything older        | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the [GitHub Security Advisories form](https://github.com/sandgraal/tiny-helpdesk-hero/security/advisories/new) to disclose vulnerabilities privately. If that workflow is unavailable, email `security@sandgraal.dev` with details and reproduction steps.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **3 business days** and provide a remediation plan or request for clarification within **10 business days**. Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a release and give credit to reporters who request it.
