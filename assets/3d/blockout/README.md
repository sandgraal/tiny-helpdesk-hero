# Blockout Drop Zone

Use this folder for the greybox scenes, turntables, and capture notes produced during the Milestone 2.6 blockout sprint.

## What to Add
- `.blend`/`.ma` scene files with the latest layout
- Proxy textures (packed into the scene) plus any helper materials
- Quick capture notes (`.md`/`.txt`) summarizing major adjustments before review
- Low-resolution MP4 or GIF walkthroughs for QA (`< 25 MB` when possible)

## File Checklist
- [ ] Camera + FOV confirmed against `docs/art/camera-monitor-plan.md`
- [ ] Monitor text legibility checked from the hero shoulder frame
- [ ] Lamp and emissive proxies aligned with empathy lighting targets
- [ ] Wall panel modules snapped to the 0.1 m grid
- [ ] Capture notes stored alongside each upload

Keep the folder tidy: remove obsolete proxies once their replacements are reviewed and logged in `docs/art/iteration-log.md`.
