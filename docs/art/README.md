# Art & UI Direction (Work in Progress)

## Visual Direction

- **Overall feel:** Early-90s meets early-2000s fusion — chunky pixel UI, graffiti-inspired overlays, and bold contrasts with metallic textures.
- **Palette:** Deep blacks, chrome silvers, neon blues, and gritty reds — think _MTV meets Doom_. Combine digital grime with street-art color pops.
- **Typography:** Pixel or bitmap fonts for in-game UI; hand-tag or stencil-style fonts for menus and splash screens.
- **Accessibility:** Maintain readable contrast ratios and avoid relying solely on color for meaning. Ensure text readability on flashing or textured backgrounds.
- **Deliverables:** Maintain all reference images, color palettes, and asset checklists in this directory.

## Audio Direction

- **Tone:** A fusion of 1990s/2000s **metal and rap** — aggressive riffs, punchy drum loops, layered samples, and rhythmic vocal textures.
- **Goal:** Capture the rebellious, high-energy crossover vibe of _Rage Against the Machine_, _Linkin Park_, and _Beastie Boys_ — but with modern production values and original content.

### Legal & Licensing Guidelines

- **Do not use copyrighted tracks or samples** from commercial artists. Even short clips from recognizable songs (vocals, riffs, drum breaks) require licenses.
- **Safer options:**
  - Use **royalty-free metal/rap fusion music** from platforms like [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/), [Pixabay Music](https://pixabay.com/music/), or [Artlist](https://artlist.io/).
  - **Commission original loops or beats** under a _work-for-hire_ or _royalty-free commercial-use license_. Retain written proof of rights.
  - If creating beats, ensure **samples are CC0 or cleared for derivative works** (avoid CC-BY-NC or restrictive commercial clauses).
- **Keep a “Music License Log”** in this directory that documents:
  - Track name, artist, and URL.
  - License type and date acquired.
  - Attribution text if required by the license.
  - Notes on whether the track blends metal/rap elements.

## Style Targets

- **Metal Layer:** Distorted guitar or bass lines, crunchy power chords, and dark harmonic pads.
- **Rap Layer:** Hip-hop drum kits, vocal chops, or rhythmic spoken elements that align with the beat.
- **Blended Style:** Keep transitions tight — metal energy for hooks and rap flow for verses or ambient background loops.
- **Production tip:** Use compression and EQ to avoid frequency clashes between guitars and drums; maintain clarity for voice samples.

## TODO

- [ ] Define final UI style guide (pixel density, button states, graffiti accent set).
- [ ] Finalize hybrid sound palette and loudness targets (-14 LUFS for streaming balance).
- [ ] Track asset production tasks and their sources.
- [ ] Maintain a music and SFX license log for auditability.
