# High-Poly Export Reports

Use this folder to capture Markdown summaries generated by `npm run analyze:gltf -- <file>.glb[@scene] --markdown --budget triangles=12000 --budget vertices=6000 --output <path>`.

Each export should ship with:
- The GLB/GLTF file in `assets/3d/final/` (or referenced in the shared drive).
- A matching Markdown report saved here detailing min/max/size/center/diagonal values, instanced vertex/triangle totals, blockout deltas, and ✅/⚠️ budget checks (triangles, vertices, etc.).
- Optional JSON output if automation is required for QA dashboards.

Name reports after the export they represent (e.g., `2024-06-15-desk.glb.md`). Include reviewer notes or next actions beneath the generated table if adjustments are needed.
