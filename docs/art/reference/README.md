# Reference Captures

Store before/after screenshots, greybox stills, and QA walkthrough exports referenced by `docs/art/iteration-log.md`. Use descriptive filenames that match the log entries (e.g., `2024-06-02-blockout-greybox.png`).

## Capture Tips
- Capture at 1280Ã—720 by default; include a secondary mobile aspect ratio when relevant.
- Export both standard and high-contrast renders if the update impacts accessibility.
- Keep files lightweight (PNG for stills, MP4/GIF for motion) so the repo stays manageable.

Log each new capture in the iteration log with notes about what changed and any follow-up actions.
