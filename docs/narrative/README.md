## Narrative Purpose

The narrative for _Tiny Helpdesk Hero_ aims to balance empathy, humor, and nostalgia — showing how frustration becomes collaboration when we listen first and joke second.  
Players take the role of an under-appreciated IT professional in the 90s–2000s tech boom, surrounded by chaos, crunchy guitar riffs, and dial-up modems. The story is about people, not machines: every laugh is earned through connection.

## Tonal Guardrails

### Voice & Tone

- **Primary tone:** Empathetic, witty, self-aware.
- **Secondary tone:** Light sarcasm that reveals understanding, not superiority.
- **Cadence:** Conversational and rhythmic — fast enough to keep energy, slow enough to feel human.

### Humor Boundaries

- ✅ **Do:** Use observational and situational humor (“Ah, the sacred art of rebooting — our ancient ritual”).
- ✅ **Do:** Laugh _with_ characters, not _at_ them.
- 🚫 **Don’t:** Use jokes about identity, ability, or background.
- 🚫 **Don’t:** Break immersion with modern slang or memes.

### Inclusivity & Language

- Write in gender-neutral, era-appropriate language.
- Favor words like “folks,” “team,” or “everyone.”
- Reflect frustration as universal — never as a personality flaw.
- Every character deserves empathy, even when wrong.

## Dialogue Style Guide

### Tone — Do’s and Don’ts

**✅ Do:**

- Sound human and conversational.
- Ask before assuming (“What were you doing when it froze?”).
- Use humor as a tension-breaker, not a shield.
- Mirror the caller’s emotion with empathy first.
- Celebrate small wins (“Yes! You opened the Control Panel — that’s basically wizard-level”).

**🚫 Don’t:**

- Be sarcastic at someone’s expense.
- Overexplain or talk down.
- Break tone with real brand names or copyrighted quotes.
- Use frustration as mockery.

## Empathy Scripting Framework

| Phase            | Caller Emotion | Agent Goal         | Tone        | Example                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Greeting**     | Irritated      | Build trust        | Warm, calm  | “Hey there, sounds like your computer’s having a moment. Let’s sort it out.” |
| **Discovery**    | Confused       | Clarify            | Curious     | “Walk me through what you’re seeing. We’ll find the gremlin together.”       |

| **Resolution**   | Relieved       | Reinforce teamwork | Celebratory | “Boom. You did it! I just translated from machine.”                          |

## Escalation Phrasing

Replace blame with reassurance:

| Instead of…                     | Try…                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “That’s not my department.”     | “Let’s get you to the right person — I’ll fill them in.”                  |
| “You shouldn’t have done that.” | “No problem — easy fix, we’ll backtrack together.”                        |
| “Calm down.”                    | “I get it — this stuff is frustrating. Let’s take it one step at a time.” |
| “I don’t know.”                 | “That’s a tricky one. Let me check and see what we can learn.”            |

## Humor Alignment

| Situation            | Example Line                                                   | Why It Works                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Mild frustration     | “Technology: undefeated since 1993.”                           | Acknowledges pain with levity.      |
| User mistake         | “It’s okay, our servers make that mistake too.”                | Builds solidarity.                  |
| Long troubleshooting | “Alright, we’re officially spelunking in system settings now.” | Adds adventure to monotony.         |
| Final fix            | “That’s how legends are made — right before lunch.”            | Ends on a triumphant, playful note. |

## Cultural & Era Anchors

- **References:** Dial-up tones, floppy disks, Y2K fear, LAN parties, mixtapes.
- **Avoid:** Direct song lyrics or real brand names — describe, don’t quote.
- **Aesthetic:** 90s tech optimism meets grunge and rap attitude — chaos wrapped in kindness.
