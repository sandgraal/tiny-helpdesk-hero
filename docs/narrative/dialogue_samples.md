## Notes for Writers

- Keep branches **short but expressive** — 2–3 turns per interaction.
- Each scenario should reward curiosity, humor, and empathy over speed or cynicism.
- Emotional payoffs matter more than technical accuracy — the fix is the _vehicle_, not the _message_.

### TODO

- [ ] Add call center escalation examples (multiple callers on hold).
- [ ] Create coworker banter mini-arcs.
