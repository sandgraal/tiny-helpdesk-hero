# Narrative & Style Guide

Tiny Helpdesk Hero lives where empathy meets absurdity. Use this guide to keep new content aligned with the core tone, humor, and emotional beats of the game.

## Guiding Pillars
- **Empathy first.** Every interaction starts from understanding the caller’s frustration before offering solutions or jokes.
- **Humor with heart.** Laugh *with* callers, not *at* them. Comedy lightens tension and rewards curiosity.
- **Era-flavored optimism.** Channel late-90s/early-2000s tech nostalgia — dial-up whirs, LAN parties, and office pranks — while keeping language inclusive and timeless.
- **Player as collaborator.** The helpdesk hero is witty, competent, and collaborative. They succeed by inviting callers into the fix, not taking over.

## Tone Matrix
| Caller Energy        | Player Response Tone          | Sample Line                                                 | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Panicked & scattered | Grounded, reassuring           | “You’re not alone — we’ll walk this tiny disaster back together.” | Anchor the scene in calm confidence. |
| Exhausted            | Warm, lightly humorous         | “I hear you. Let’s rescue your work and your sanity in one go.” | Humor should affirm effort, not dismiss fatigue. |
| Overconfident        | Playful, inviting collaboration| “Love the energy! Let’s channel it into the settings menu for a minute.” | Redirect bravado into shared problem solving. |
| Hyper-focused gamer  | Competitive camaraderie        | “Alright, speedrunner — new strat: gentle USB insertion, go!” | Mirror excitement while guiding next steps. |
| Deadpan skeptic      | Respectful candor with wit      | “Fair. Tech is dramatic. Let’s ask it nicely anyway.”        | Keep sharp humor, but show respect. |

## Twist & Meta Humor Guidelines
- Twists are empathy prompts, not punchlines. They reveal hidden pressures or delightful chaos (office ghosts, alternate shifts, micro desk buddy).
- Meta references should support immersion. When callers reference the “tiny helpdesk hero,” respond in-universe: you’re legendary *because* of empathy, not snark.
- Each twist needs a grounded emotional response plus a playful image. Example:
  - **Twist:** `office-ghost`
  - **Player Reaction:** “Perfect. We’ll exorcise the settings menu and leave out some static-free snacks.”

## Scene Structure Checklist
1. **Hook** – Acknowledge the caller’s opener in their language (repeat keywords).
2. **Empathy Beat** – Validate the feeling before troubleshooting.
3. **Choice Framing** – Offer options with clear outcomes and comedic flavor.
4. **Micro-win Celebration** – When progress happens, highlight it with a short compliment or joke.
5. **Outro** – Leave the caller with encouragement, micro-call-back to the twist, or playful challenge.

## Dialogue Patterns
```text
Caller panic → Player calm humor → Guided question → Confirmation → Encouraging wrap
Caller sarcasm → Player matching smirk → Collaborative fix → Shared joke → Empowered goodbye
Caller self-blame → Player reframes as curiosity → Gentle instruction → Shared success → “You did that.”
```

## Language & Style Rules
- **Inclusive defaults:** Use gender-neutral pronouns unless a caller self-identifies. Refer to groups as “team,” “folks,” “everyone.”
- **Era flavor:** Mention dial-up, floppy disks, mixtapes, LAN cables. Avoid direct copyrighted quotes or modern meme slang.
- **Sentence rhythm:** Mix short affirmations (“You’ve got this.”) with lively descriptors (“Let’s coax the printer out of existential crisis mode.”).
- **Positive reinforcement:** Celebrate effort (“You navigated three menus under pressure — that’s hero work.”).

## Humor Safety Nets
| Risk Zone              | Redirect Strategy                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Caller embarrassment   | Normalize the mistake (“Everyone hits send too early sometimes.”). |
| Repeated failure       | Share the blame (“This UI is allergic to clarity — we’ll tame it.”). |
| Time pressure spirals  | Zoom out (“Minute spent breathing saves ten fixing the wrong thing.”). |
| Meta jokes overuse     | Anchor back (“Legend status aside, I still need you to click ‘Apply.’”). |

## Narrative QA Checklist (per new call)
- [ ] Persona voice matches snapshot above.
- [ ] Problem description uses sensory detail (sights/sounds/feelings).
- [ ] Options include one empathetic success, one comic-but-ineffective, one wildly unhelpful.
- [ ] Twist integrates into the prompt and payoff.
- [ ] Empathy win/fail lines reinforce teamwork and tone.
- [ ] Dialogue avoids identity-based humor or outdated stereotypes.
- [ ] References stay within era-compatible tech/culture.

## Collaboration Notes
- *Writers* – Flag new personas, twists, or tonal experiments in PR descriptions.
- *Designers* – Sync with audio to match achievement cues and twist moods.
- *Playtesters* – Record lines that feel mean, confusing, or anachronistic; capture verbatim player reactions where possible.

## Future TODOs
- [ ] Add empathy response matrices for alternate player archetypes (efficient vs. compassionate).
- [ ] Document “failure loop” scripts that keep humor intact after multiple wrong answers.
- [ ] Align with audio direction once persona motifs expand.
- [ ] Source narrative inspiration playlists (grunge, synthwave, lo-fi office jams).
