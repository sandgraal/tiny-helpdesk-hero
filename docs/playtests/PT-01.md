# Playtest Session — 2024-04-24

- **Build:** commit 397a188 (accessibility panel + responsive UI)
- **Facilitator:** Chris Ennis
- **Participants:**
  - Alex — returning player on 1080p desktop (mouse + keyboard)
  - Priya — new player on iPad Air (touch input)
- **Session window:** 18:00–18:45 PT (15 min prep, 25 min live session, 5 min wrap)
- **Scenario focus:** Achievements onboarding, expanded call variety, accessibility controls

## Goals
- Validate that players notice and understand the achievement panel.
- Observe whether the expanded call library keeps tone fresh.
- Test accessibility panel (text scaling, dyslexia font, high contrast) on both devices.

## Session Outline
1. Warm-up & context (5 min)
2. Guided playthrough on desktop (15 min)
3. Guided playthrough on tablet with accessibility toggles (15 min)
4. Debrief interviews (10 min)

## Notes
### Observations
- Caller empathy reactions:
  - Alex immediately recognized the empathy meter and aimed for perfect selections; noted that the empathy pulse cue helped.
  - Priya needed one prompt to understand the empathy score but appreciated the celebratory text.
- Achievement unlock reactions:
  - Both participants noticed the achievement panel highlighting new badges; Priya suggested a subtle sound cue for unlocks on tablet.
- UI/controls feedback:
  - Desktop controls felt "snappy"; Alex requested larger option hit boxes when using high-contrast mode.
  - Tablet touch input worked but Priya found the achievements panel slightly intrusive at the bottom; suggested auto-hide after a few seconds.
- Narrative tone alignment:
  - Call variety felt fresh; returning player especially enjoyed the puzzle-streamer lines. Priya asked for more hints when empathy fails.

### Quotes
- “That achievements panel makes me feel like the office is cheering with me.” — Alex
- “Text scaling plus that dyslexia font made the tablet run comfy.” — Priya

### Issues / Bugs
- [ ] Achievements panel overlaps option text on small tablet when text scale ≥ 1.25 (low impact, reproducible on iPad Air)
- [ ] No audio cue for achievement unlocks; players expect a chime (minor impact)

### Opportunities
- [ ] Consider auto-hiding achievements panel after 5 seconds on touch devices (Priya feedback)
- [ ] Explore empathy hint tooltip when player drops below 50% score

## Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Assign to UI polish — address panel overlap / auto-hide idea
- [ ] Assign to Audio — evaluate unlock chime
- [ ] Schedule PT-02 by 2024-04-28 (focus on mobile + accessibility)
