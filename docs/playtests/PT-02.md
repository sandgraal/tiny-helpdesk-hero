# Playtest Session — 2024-04-28

- **Build:** commit bcfc9f1 (achievement chime + auto-hide panel)
- **Facilitator:** Chris Ennis (backup: TBD)
- **Participants:**
  - Maya — new player on Pixel 6 (Chrome, touch)
  - Jordan — new player on Surface Laptop (Edge, trackpad)
- **Scenario focus:** Onboarding clarity, touch interactions, high-contrast mode validation
- **Session window:** 17:00–17:40 PT (10 min prep, 25 min live, 5 min wrap)

## Goals
- Measure comprehension of empathy mechanic without prior exposure.
- Validate achievements panel visibility once overlap tweaks land.
- Capture feedback on accessibility controls from first-time users.

## Session Outline
1. Warm-up & onboarding walkthrough (5 min)
2. Mobile-first free play (15 min)
3. Desktop empathy focus scenario (10 min)
4. Accessibility toggles demo + feedback (5 min)
5. Debrief (5 min)

## Notes
### Observations
- Maya (Pixel 6) immediately noticed the collapsed achievements stub; tap-to-expand worked reliably and auto-hide resumed after 4 seconds of inactivity.
- Jordan (Surface Laptop) completed the shift using only mouse/trackpad; empathy hint surfaced once and was read aloud without confusion.
- Text scaling at 1.25× and 1.5× kept option buttons readable on both devices with no clipping; achievements panel resized appropriately.
- High-contrast mode improved readability on mobile outdoors; both players toggled it successfully mid-session.

### Quotes
- “The little hint bubble saved me when I blanked out—nice safety net.” — Jordan
- “I like that the achievements tuck away. Maybe make the stub icon a bit bigger?” — Maya

### Issues / Bugs
- [x] Collapsed achievements stub button feels small on Pixel 6; Maya missed it once (suggest larger tap target ≥ 44px). *(Addressed 2024-04-29; validate in PT-03.)*
- [ ] Accessibility panel on mobile overlaps browser URL bar when rotated landscape (low priority; note for polish).

### Opportunities
- [x] Consider shortening empathy hint text for mobile (current line wraps twice in portrait). *(Copy updated 2024-04-29.)*
- [ ] Explore subtle vibration or haptic feedback on achievement unlock for mobile devices.

### Accessibility Verification Targets
- [x] Achievements panel auto-hide + toggle feels intuitive on tablet.
- [x] High-contrast mode readability confirmed on both devices.
- [x] Text scaling (1.25×) keeps options readable with no overlap.
- [x] Empathy hint overlay understood by new players.

## Follow-up Actions
- [x] File UI issue: increase collapsed achievements stub button size and padding. *(Implemented 2024-04-29; monitor in PT-03.)*
- [ ] File accessibility note: review landscape layout of accessibility panel (optional polish).
- [x] Decide on empathy hint copy length (narrative review).
- [ ] Schedule PT-03 (mobile + accessibility regression) by 2024-05-05
