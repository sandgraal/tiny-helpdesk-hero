# PT-03 Prep Checklist

## Build & Assets
- [x] Confirm build commit: `6883a4e` (stub resize, keyboard nav, haptics).
- [ ] Deploy latest `/public` bundle to Pixel 6 & desktop test device.
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation works in local build (Tab/Arrow + Enter) before session.

## Devices & Environment
- Pixel 6 (Chrome, touch + haptic) — ensure battery ≥ 70%, optional screen record.
- Desktop (Edge or Chrome) with keyboard focus (Jordan) — confirm keyboard accessible.

## Manual Smoke Pass (pre-session)
- [ ] Touch: achievements stub open/close after auto-hide; high-contrast and text scale 1.5×.
- [ ] Keyboard: Play shift using only keyboard to confirm focus ring and restart support.
- [ ] Accessibility panel: rotate Pixel landscape to confirm layout adjustments.

## Session Materials
- `docs/playtests/PT-03.md` note template.
- `docs/playtests/accessibility-verification.md` to log pending checks (high-contrast OS, etc.).
- Screen recording consent.

## Logistics
- Meeting link: TBD (schedule for 2024-05-03 @ 16:30 PT).
- Confirm participants: contact returning touch user & keyboard-focused participant (send calendar invite).
- Backup plan: gather asynchronous feedback if scheduling conflicts arise.
