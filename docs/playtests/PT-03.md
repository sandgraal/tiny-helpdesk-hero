# Playtest Session — 2024-05-03

- **Build:** commit 6883a4e (keyboard nav, haptics) or later.
- **Facilitator:** Chris Ennis
- **Participants:**
  - Maya — returning touch user on Pixel 6 (Chrome, haptics on)
  - Jordan — keyboard-focused player on Surface Book (Edge)
- **Scenario focus:** Accessibility regression (touch targets, panel layout), keyboard navigation prototype, empathy hint clarity
- **Session window:** Target 16:30–17:10 PT (10 min prep, 25 min live, 5 min wrap)

## Goals
- Confirm achievements stub toggle works comfortably on touch devices.
- Validate accessibility panel behaves correctly in landscape and portrait.
- Gather baseline feedback on keyboard navigation plan (if prototype is ready) or expectations.

## Session Outline
1. Warm-up & recap of changes (5 min)
2. Touch regression tour (auto-hide, stub toggle) (10 min)
3. Keyboard focus test (desktop) (if implemented) or expectations interview (10 min)
4. Accessibility panel + empathy hint review (5 min)
5. Debrief & next steps (5 min)

## Notes
### Observations
- Maya comfortably toggled the achievements stub; the larger button felt “natural” and didn’t overlap options.
- Jordan completed a full shift using keyboard controls only; focus ring visibility and Enter activation worked without issue.
- Accessibility panel remained clear of mobile browser chrome in both portrait and landscape thanks to safe-area tweaks.
- Empathy hint popped once on each device and was described as “helpful without being naggy.”

### Quotes
- “That little stub is perfect now—big enough to tap, not in the way.” — Maya
- “Feels like using a controller; arrow keys to pick, space to lock it in.” — Jordan

### Issues / Bugs
- [x] Accessibility panel still nicks the Pixel landscape URL bar when the browser UI auto-hides (minor polish; retest after landscape reposition patch). *(Resolved via visualViewport safe-area watcher 2024-05-27; confirm during PT-03R capture.)*
- [x] Collapsed achievements stub wasn’t focusable via keyboard; post-session fix adds keyboard toggle (verify in regression).

### Opportunities
- [ ] Reduce auto-hide delay when navigating solely with keyboard. *(Keyboard timer cap lowered to 1.5s; verify in next session.)*
- [ ] Explore optional haptic pulse for critical empathy drops. *(New haptic pattern added for incorrect selections; confirm comfort + clarity.)*

## Follow-up Actions
- [x] File enhancement: keyboard focus for achievements stub toggle. (Implemented post-session 2024-05-03).
- [x] Log accessibility note: landscape overlap edge case.
- [ ] Close out accessibility checklist items after verification
- [ ] Schedule PT-03R regression session (Pixel + keyboard focus) ahead of Milestone 3.
